# Watchiot SDK for Ruby

If you want to create an monitor agent in **Ruby** we suggest use this **gem**, it contains easy way to interact with our api.

## Install

```bash
$ gem install wiot_sdk
```

## Usage

First you need to add the dependence in your *Gemfile* project 

```ruby
gem 'wiot_sdk', '~> 0.1'
```

Then you have to require the sdk where are you going to use it

```ruby
require 'wiot_sdk'
```

or

```ruby
require 'wiot-sdk'
```
it work too

Now you have to initialice the **SDK** setting the mandatory configuration variables that always will be send in each request. This parameters are:

**api key**, **name space** and **name project**
 
```ruby
def init_sdk
  my_api_key = 'asd123asd-23asd-123sda-1231234saa'
  my_namespace = 'my_space'
  my_project = 'my_project'
  
  client = WiotSdk.init my_api_key, my_namespace, my_project
end
```

The other way is put it into configuration file **yml** or **json** format and then set the path where this parameters are setting. 

```ruby
def init_sdk
  my_config_json = '/home/myhome/my_agent/my_agent.json'
 
  client = WiotSdk.init my_config_json
end
```

```ruby
def init_sdk
  my_config_yml = '/home/myhome/my_agent/my_agent.yml'
  
  client = WiotSdk.init my_config_yml
end
```
Example of config file

* json
```json
{
  api_key: "asd123asd-23asd-123sda-1231234saa",
  space  : "my_space",
  project: "my_project"
}
```

* yml
```yml
api_key: "asd123asd-23asd-123sda-1231234saa"
space  : "my_space"
project: "my_project"
```

Now you are ready to send us a request with the metrics that you recollect.

To fill the **metric** we provide you a *Metric class*

```ruby
require 'wiot_sdk/metric'

def fill_metric
 metric = Metric.new
 
 metric.add('my_param1', 'my_malue1')
 metric.add('my_param2', 'my_malue2')
 metric.add('my_param3', 'my_malue3')
 ...
 metric.add('my_paramN', 'my_malueN')
end
```
Whe you have the **metric** only you need send a **request** to us

```ruby

def request
 client = init_sdk
 metric = fill_metric
 
 response = client.send metric
end
```

* Response
 
If all was fine you are going to recive

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

```ruby

def request
 client = init_sdk
 metric = fill_metric
 
 response = client.send metric
 puts response.code
end
```

OUTPUT: 200
